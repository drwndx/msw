            <h1>Plan Your Day!</h1>
            <p>Hey everyone, we just wanted to take this time to give you some information about the wedding and the reception!</p>

            <p>There will be plenty of parking across the street from the venue, but we do encourage light rail usage or ride sharing to the event.</p>

            <p>We suggest showing up between 2:00pm to 2:30pm so you can visit and get situated before the big show.</p>

            <p>At 2:50, you'll experience the shock and awe of the bridal party taking the stage.</p>

            <p>At 3pm, you're going to get to witness one of the most beautiful moments in your lives as Sarah will get led down the aisle by her father, John.</p>

            <p>When 3:30pm rolls around, you'll get your opportunity to mingle with everyone while enjoying fresh hors d'oeuvres and even fresher drinks. During this time you will also be able to get some great photos and play some yard games.</p>

            <p>Dinner will be served at 5pm by our lovely friends Felicia and Moises of Taquero's Authentic Street Taco Grill.</p>
