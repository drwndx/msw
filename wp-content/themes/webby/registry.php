                    <h2>Where are we registered?</h2>
                    <p>After heavy discussion about our wedding and life, we have chosen not to have an official wedding registry. We will graciously accept any gifts.</p>
                    <h2>Why is that?!</h2>
                    <p>We have been a couple for quite a long time and came into the relationship with nearly two full sets of everything a couple would need in order to have a functioning household.</p>
                    <h2>What can you do instead?</h2>
                    <p>Anything you like.  We will graciously accept any all gifts that you personally feel we would enjoy and/or need as newly married couple.<!--Additionally, we do have our eyes already set on the next big milestones for our lives. If you would like to endorse those milestones, we do have these options:--></p>
